			paragraph Styling
		</h1>
		<p>
			To style a paragraph p tag in HTML using external CSS without using IDs or classes, you can directly 			reference the p tag in the external CSS file. This allows you to apply styles to all p elements on the 				page. The CSS file can define properties like font size, color, margin, text alignment, and line height. 				You simply link the CSS file to the HTML document, and the styles defined for the p tag will apply 				universally to all paragraphs in the document.
		</p>
		<p class="highlight">
			To style a paragraph in HTML using an external CSS file with a class selector, you assign a class to the 				paragraph element in your HTML and then reference that class in the external CSS file to apply styles.
		</p>
		<p id="two">
			To style a paragraph in HTML using an external CSS file with an ID selector, you assign an ID to the 			paragraph element and then reference that ID in the external CSS file.

			An ID is unique to a specific element, and in the CSS file, it is prefixed with a # symbol. This allows 				you to apply styles specifically to that element.
